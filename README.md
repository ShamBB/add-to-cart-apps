# Real-Time Shopping Cart
The Real-Time Shopping Cart project is a web application designed to help users keep track of their shopping lists or any similar items. This project allows users to add items to their cart, remove items, and view their cart in real-time. The application utilizes HTML, vanilla JavaScript, CSS for the front-end, and Firebase as the real-time database. This means that any updates made to the shopping cart on one device (e.g., laptop) will automatically reflect on another device (e.g., phone), providing seamless synchronization.
